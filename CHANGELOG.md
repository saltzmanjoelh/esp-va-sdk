## ChangeLog

### v1.0b1r7 (Beta) - 2019-01-08

**Enhancements**

* Support for Google Voice Assistant (GVA) and Google Dialogflow (Alpha release). Please check README of each voice assistant to get started.
* Support to play custom tones from application.
* nvs-set CLI supports setting and getting int8_t variable type.

**API Changes**

* Example directories are renamed.
* Many structures, functions and header files with "alexa" prefix are renamed with "va" prefix. Please follow README-FIRST.md if you want to compile and run older examples with new SDK.

**Bug Fixes**

* Background noise in audio with lower sampling rates.
* In case of incorrect provisioning parameters, device needed to be reset via command line (via esptool.py on host or nvs-erase on device). Now reset-to-factory push button (Mode) could also be used.
* Capabilities are announced automatically when an updated firmware with new capabilities is flashed onto the device.
* More SNTP servers are added for faster time synchronization on device boot-up.

**Known Issues/Improvements**

* Only limited TuneIn radio stations are supported
* It is largely tested with internet and WiFi connectivity intact throughout its operation. Some issues are seen when device loses connectivity.

### v1.0b1r6 (Beta) - 2018-12-24

**Enhancements**

* Support for local mp3 playback. Example application has also been added.
* Support for EqualizerController interface. Just facilitating APIs are added, user should register and implement callback function for actual Equalizer control.
* Support for CLI-based PlaybackController interface. Play, pause, next, previous, button and toggle commands are supported. "button" CLI can be used to emulate button press on the device. Or application can call appropriate API from playback_controller.h to notify SDK of button press (if user wants to implement hardware button).
* Support for CLI based WiFi provisioning. App is still required for Amazon authentication.

**API Changes**

* Removed support for static authentication (AVS partition based authentication).

**Bug Fixes**

* Fixed bugs related to stability and device getting stuck in infinite loop in some cases.

**Known Issues/Improvements**

* Only limited TuneIn radio stations are supported
* It is largely tested with internet and WiFi connectivity intact throughout its operation. Some issues are seen when device loses connectivity.

### v1.0b1r5 (Beta) - 2018-11-12

**Enhancements**

* TLS Certificate validation of Amazon and other streaming sites.

**API Changes**

* http_connection_new now requires pointer to esp_tls_cfg_t object.
* Check application's README for a new patch on esp-idf, without which compilation will fail with this release.

**Bug Fixes**

* Device goes in infinite loop if internet goes down while responding to "What's up?"
* Other minor exception fixes

**Known Issues/Improvements**

* Only limited TuneIn radio stations are supported

**Bug Fixes**

* Stability related fixes
* Fixed crashes seen in Audible when segments >512 are received

**Known Issues/Improvements**
